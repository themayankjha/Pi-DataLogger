# UltrasonicRaspberry DataLogger + GraphPlotter
 Built for RaspberryPi in Python.
 This Code senses if an Ultrasonic Sensor connected to defined pins reads distance less than 35 cm for 10 seconds and 
 logs the current time in the format Hour.Minute to a text file.
 Another Python Script made works on the generated text file and plots a histogram on the data.
 the histogram is then saved as a png file with its name as the current date in a folder
